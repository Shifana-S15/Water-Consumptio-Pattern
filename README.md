Water Consumption and Extraction Tracker

This project is a monitoring and alert system designed for a cement-based company to track water consumption across various extraction and usage points. The system visualizes water flow, provides real-time updates, and alerts when water usage exceeds defined limits, ensuring efficient water resource management.

Features:

Sankey Diagram Visualization: Provides a clear, interactive view of water flow from extraction points to usage locations.
Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks water consumption levels and provides instant updates.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts when consumption at any usage point exceeds set thresholds.
Modular Code Structure: Code is organized into six modules, each handling a specific part of the system, with a main file to integrate all components.
Technology Stack

Frontend: PyQt5 for creating an interactive user interface.
Backend: Python for data processing and system integration.
Data Visualization: Sankey diagrams for visualizing water flow and usage.

Code Structure:
The project consists of six modular code pages, each addressing a specific functionality of the system, along with a main file to integrate them all
